				<h2>Tips On How To Save Money While In College?</h2>
					<p>

<font size= 4>
				<p1><strong>Be smart</strong> with credit cards and checking accounts.<br>
				College kids are easy targets! Building positive credit is important, but it can also be challenging to be both responsible and on a budget. If you do take a credit card, only use it for emergencies and pay it off as soon as possible.</p3>


				<p>
					<strong>Always</strong> ask about the student discounts.</br>
					Many stores have them, even if they are not advertised. As long as you have your student ID to show, it is possible to save 10%-15% on your purchases at your favorite stores. UniDays is an app you sign up for and get discounts on food, fashion,  tech, & more! up to 50% off.
				</p>

				<p>
				<strong>Texts Books</strong></br>
						If you can buy your textbooks great! If not or you just want to save money, try to go to the college's library and rent the textbooks. If the teacher uses it once in a while to give homework, than you can just borrow from a friend.
				</p>

				<p>
						<strong>Coffee</strong></br>
							It feels cool to walk around and have a cup of coffe in your hand, makes you feel professional, but buying a latte every morning costs money. Buy a coffe machine and just drink normal coffee! that money you use for starbucks can be used for other things in college.
				</p>

						<p>

							<strong>Scholarships</strong></br>
							<em>Scholarships help you pay for your education. Scholarships are financial aid awards designed to help students pay for college. Sometimes the scholarships is a one-time check. Other collage scholarships are renewable and provide money for students each semester or school year.These awards differ from students loans in that they don't have to be repaid.</em>
