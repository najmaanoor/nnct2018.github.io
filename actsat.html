			      <font size="4"><p1> <b>What is the SAT?</b></p1>
			      <br>
			      <p2>The SAT is an entrance exam used by most colleges and universities to make admissions decisions. The purpose of the SAT is to measure a high school student's readiness for college.  College admissions officers will review standardized test scores alongside your high school GPA, the classes you took in high school ect.</p2>
			      <br><br>
			      <p3><b>When should I take the SAT?</b></p3>
			      <br>
			      <p4>Most high school students take the SAT during the spring of their junior year or fall of their senior year. It's important to leave time to re-take the test if you need to raise your score before you apply to college. The SAT exam is offered nationally every year on specific dates. View all upcoming on dates on the College Board website. </p4>
			      <br><br>

SAT Essay scores are reported separately from overall test scores. Some colleges may require that you complete the SAT Essay. You can confirm each college's admissions policies on the school website. </p6>
			      <br><br>
			      <p7><b>How long is the SAT?</b></p7>

			      <br><br>
			      <p11><b>How do I register for the SAT?</b></p11>

			    <h2><strong><center><font size="7"> ACT</font> </strong></center></h2>
			    <br><br>
			    <div class="container-fluid">
			      <p15> <b>What is the ACT?</b></p1>
			      <br>
			      <p16>The ACT is an time based entrance exam used by most colleges and universities to make admissions decisions. The purpose of the ACT test is also to measure a high school student's readiness for college, and provide colleges with one common data point that can be used to compare all applicants. It has the same purpose as the SAT. </p2>
			      <br><br>
			      <p17><b>When should I take the ACT?</b></p3>
			      <br>
			      <p18>Most high school students take the ACT during the spring of their junior year or fall of their senior year. It's important to leave time to re-take the test if you need to raise your score before you apply to college. The ACT exam is offered nationally every year on specific dates. View all upcoming on dates on the College Board website.</p4>
			      <br><br>
			      <p19><b>What is on the ACT?</b></p5>
			      <br>
			      <p20>There are four ACT sections: English, Reading, Math, Science. The ACT also includes an optional 40-minute Writing Test. Some colleges may require that you complete the ACT Writing Test. You can confirm each college's admissions policies on the school's website.</p6>
			      <br><br>
			      <p21><b>How long is the ACT?</b></p7>
			      <br>
			      <p22>The ACT is 2 hours and 55 minutes long. If you choose to take the ACT with Essay, the test will be 3 hours and 35 minutes long. There are special exceptions for people with learning disablities. </p8>
			      <br><br>
			      <p23><b>How is the ACT scored?</b></p9>
			      <br>
			      <p24>Each section of the ACT is scored on a 1 to 36 point scale. Your composite ACT score is the average of your four section scores, also on a scale from 1 to 36. If you take the ACT with Writing Test, you will receive a separate score on the Writing Test.</p10>
			      <br><br>
			      <p25><b>How do I register for the ACT?</b></p9>
			      <br>
			      <p26>Registration deadlines fall approximately five weeks before each ACT test date. You can get registration materials from your school counselor, or you can register online on the ACT website.</p10>
			      <br><br>
			      <p27><b>How can I prep for the ACT?</b></p9>
			      <br>
			      <p28>Just like the SAT, there are prep books, online videos, and programs that help raise your ACT score. </p10>
			      <br><br
			      <p29><b>Should I take the SAT or the ACT?</b></p9>
			      <br>
			      <p30>Most colleges and universities will accept scores from either the SAT or ACT, and do not favor one test over the other. That said, college-bound students are increasingly taking both the SAT and ACT. Changes made to the SAT in 2016 have made it easier than ever to prep for both tests concurrentlyâ€”and earn competitive scores on both! The best way to decide if taking the SAT, ACT, or both tests is right for you is to take a timed  full-length practice test  of each type. Since the content and style of the SAT and ACT are very similar, factors like how you handle time pressure and what types of questions you find most challenging can help you determine which test is a better fit. </p10>
